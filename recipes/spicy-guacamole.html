      Do you know how to make spicy guacamole dip? This chunky guacamole is our
      favorite movie night treat. And it’s probably the easiest snack too. It’s
      ready in less than 5 minutes or so. You can make it even when the guests
      arrive for a party, which is the ideal time indeed. Don’t make it ahead of
      time! A rich, flavorsome, citrusy guacamole is best when served fresh. It
      might lose color otherwise. I don’t even need tortilla chips or anything
      else, just give me a spoon and a big bowl of this –oh this so yummy
      guacamole disappears in seconds.

      A classic guacamole doesn’t have a precise recipe, everyone can make it in
      their way. You need some basic ingredients for a perfect guacamole but you
      see thousands of different recipes around the web. The reason for this is
      that everyone uses the measurements according to their taste. There is no
      one rule for the measurements, so taste it while making, adjust it for you
      and find your best guacamole recipe that way. You can even add an extra
      ingredient you think that will go perfect in this amazing dip. Our
      guacamole has finely chopped red chilies as an extra kick.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ripe avocado</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh lime juice</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped red chilies</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro (parsley or mint if you don’t like
        cilantro)
      </li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Cut the avocado in half. Using a spoon, remove the seed and then scoop
        out the flesh. Put it in a mixing bowl or in a mortar. Mash the avocado
        with a fork or in the mortar. But do it roughly and leave chunks in it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Immediately add in the lime juice so that the avocado won’t get brown
        quickly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in the rest of the ingredients, taste and make any changes that you
        think necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        I recommend you to make this guacamole right before serving, otherwise
        it might lose color. The fresher, the better.
      </li>
    </ol>
