      Fresh fava beans can be found only in spring but dry fava beans are at the
      markets all year round. If you have fresh fava beans on hand, then you
      should check out our basic fresh fava bean recipe and whole fava beans
      with tomatoes. Today, we are sharing one of our favorite dips: Dried fava
      dip.

    <p>
      This fava dip is a popular mezze in Turkey, which is also called “fava” in
      Turkish. It is often served with several other mezze dishes including
      Turkish fritters, haydari, authentic hummus, babaganoush and cacik.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound (450g) dried fava beans</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3 cup hot water</li>
      <li>1 lemon, juice only</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ cup fresh dill, chopped</li>
      <li>Red pepper flakes and fresh dill for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Soak dried fava beans for <strong>6-7 hours or overnight</strong>. Drain
        and rinse them well..
      </li>
      <li>
        Peel their skin off by pinching each bean between your thumb and
        forefinger. Put them aside. You will have
        <strong>about 1 and ½ cups</strong> shelled beans.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a pan and cook finely chopped onion until translucent.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in peeled fava beans and pour <strong>3 cups hot</strong> water over
        them. Cook covered until the beans are tender, stirring occasionally.
        This might take <strong>1 hour</strong>. Add extra water (start with
        <strong>¼ cup</strong> and add more if needed) if all the water is
        absorbed but the beans haven’t become tender yet. Remove from the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add in lemon juice, salt and finely chopped fresh dill and put them in a
        food processor. Pulse until creamy. If it is too thick and hard to
        pulse, add a little cold water. Start with
        <strong>1-2 tablespoons</strong> of water and check if more is needed to
        have a creamy texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate at least for <strong>30 minutes</strong> before serving.
      </li>
      <li>
        Serve with extra olive oil, fresh dill and red pepper flakes on it.
      </li>
    </ol>
