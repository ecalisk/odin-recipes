      This dish is an extremely popular traditional dish in Turkey, despite not
      being so well-known in other areas of the world. With a few simple
      ingredients that are in perfect ratio, you can expect a spicy yet
      refreshing pallet.

      Although this dish definitely requires some work, most of it is in the
      kneading process. The <strong>bulgur wheat</strong> must be kneaded for a
      long time to help soften it and make it edible. This kneading is also
      necessary to help develop some deep and complex flavor that ultimately
      gives you this delicious dish.

      <li>2 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon pepper paste</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water</li>
      <li>100 ml olive oil</li>
      <li>4 tablespoon isot pepper/Urfa biber</li>

      <li>2 tablespoon pomegranate molasses</li>
      <li>¼ cup finely chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large bowl or a tray, combine bulgur, black pepper, cumin, sumac,
        allspice, pureed tomato, onion and garlic, tomato paste, pepper paste
        and water. Knead this mixture using your palms for about
        <strong>2 minutes</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, mix together the olive oil, isot pepper and red
        pepper flakes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour this mixture along with the lemon juice and pomegranate molasses
        over the bulgur mixture. Knead it until bulgur is softer and not crunchy
        at all. This might take <strong>45-50 minutes</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>Taste and add more salt if needed.</li>
      <li>Add in finely chopped parsley.</li>
      <li>
        Take about <strong>2 tablespoon</strong> of the mixture in your hand and
        shape it by making your hand a fist. Wet your fingers or wear gloves
        when shaping çiğköfte so that it won’t stick.
      </li>
    </ol>
